## Repo for polytech web class
## Website created using the SvelteKit framework
## Resources used include class Moodle, Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, SvelteKit Docs

# Known bugs/immediate improvements
   When using the nav bar to go beween the pages, if you have not yet scrolled there is no way (aside from the current link) to tell if you have changed pages.
  Might need to make the header for each page unique in some way. Maybe unique title?
  
# Future Improvements
  Website is quite bland and boring. More features need to be added, along with more content. Maybe more API fetched content?
  Nav hover should be specific depending on which link you hover on. 
  On scroll features in line with word doc provided.

  "Give me three seperate paragraphs about coffee. Each should have a different subtopic/theme"
  
  Certainly! Here are even shorter versions of the three paragraphs about coffee:

  History and Origins: Coffee originated in Ethiopia and spread across Arabia and Europe, connecting people with its enticing flavors and stimulating effects.
  
  Art of Brewing: Brewing coffee is an art that offers a unique sensory experience, where attention to detail and different methods bring out the best flavors.
  
  Health Benefits: Coffee may have health benefits, including antioxidants that reduce the risk of certain diseases and potential improvements in cognition, mood, and heart health with moderate consumption.
  
  These concise versions provide a brief glimpse into each subtopic of coffee, conveying the main ideas with brevity.
